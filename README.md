# mazegen
An ASCII/Unicode maze generator and solver that runs in your Linux shell. See colorful, wacky, customized mazes unfold in your terminal in real time.

# usage

```
Mazegen 1.0 by Travis Ziegler
Program to generate and solve ASCII/Unicode mazes

Usage:  mazegen [-d width height] [-r delay] [-s delay] [-p char] [-w char] [-s char] [-v iter] [-o]

Options: 
  -d <width> <height>	specify the maze dimensions
  -r			use the default realtime generation delay
  -r <delay>  		specify generation delay in milliseconds per iteration
  -s			instantly solve the maze after generation
  -s <delay>		specify solve draw delay in milliseconds per iteration
  -p <char>   		specify the path characer
  -w <char>   		specify the wall (background) character
  -f <char>		specify the solved path character after maze finished generation
  -o 			file output mode; output is formatted for file. Use &> operator
  -v <iter>		verbose mode; program is run <iter> times to calculate avg elapsed time

Example: 
  mazegen -d 40 20 -r -s 50 -w â–ˆ -p . 
```
Note: the -r and -s options enable realtime generation, meaning the maze is animated as it is being generated or solved. This leads to some rather cool visuals.

Special thanks to the Computerphile Youtube channel for inspiring me to implement these types of depth-first-search algorithms. It's been quite fun, and the outcome is just fantastic to look at.
